<h1>MY<span style="color: red;"> PET</span> BARKY</h1>
<p>As they say a Dog is man's best friend, <b>Barky</b> is more than a friend and its more like family. <br>
Barky came into my life on my <strong>10th birthday</strong> and i can boldy say from that day my was never the same. <br>
Barky is a cold,shy but rough dog when you meet it for the first but lovely,playful and funny when its gets to know you.
<p>My dad got Barky from a pet shop called <a href="https://www.petco.com">petco.com </a> when they held an adoption event. <br>
It has a brownish gold cuddly fur back with a white flat tummy and a black nose coupled with white swirl on the face.<br>
Barky's <mark>aggressive</mark> and <mark>rough</mark> nature made everyone afraid to adopt it but my dad saw it was behaving that way because it was deprived of love. <br>
